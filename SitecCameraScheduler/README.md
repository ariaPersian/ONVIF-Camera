# SitecCameraScheduler

This project aims to provide a fresh implementation for scheduling camera operations. It is inspired by the logic of the previous ONVIF-Camera project but built from scratch.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the scheduler:
   ```bash
   python scheduler.py
   ```
